Google Play Store Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ie.mylifesolutions.superme&hl=en

The aim of the app was to provide children with information and tools on how to deal with bullying. 
It is aimed at children who have gone through the MyLifeSolutions workshops and to be downloaded as an extra to assist them afterwards.
The app is very graphical and interactive and provides information about the Super Tools used to help children who are being bullied along with stories which allow the users to follow the Hero SuperMe and see how he uses his Super Tools to conquer bullies.


This app was developed as part of a hackathon event which iSkill Training Ltd hosted for learners from their previous software developement courses. The aim was to provide learners with Android app development experience and have a fun time writing code with their own classmates and people from other courses.
